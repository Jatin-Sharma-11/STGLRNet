# STGLR  
**Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning with Retrieved Receptive Field Expansion for Traffic Flow Forecasting**

STGLR is a deep learning framework for high-precision traffic flow forecasting that addresses *spatio-temporal illusions*—cases where similar short-term histories lead to divergent futures due to limited context. The model dynamically retrieves relevant historical patterns via a memory-based receptive field expansion and jointly learns multi-view spatial dependencies and periodic temporal structures. STGLR achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmark datasets, including PEMS03/04/07/08 and METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, demonstrating strong long-horizon stability and robustness.
